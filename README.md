# Machine Learning Models for Phase Prediction in Polymer-Induced Self Assembly

## Setup
To replicate the experiments, you have to have Python of version at least 3.7 installed on your machine. In addition you have to install dependencies via:

```
pip3 install -r requirements
```

Note:
RuleFit rules are not stable because author use set() to add rules. To keep rulefit stable, you need to replace original `rulefit.py` with `rulefit.py` in our modules.
